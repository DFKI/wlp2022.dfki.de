      We report on a tool for analyzing and adapting test suites for Prolog in
      an educational setting. The key idea is to mutate a known-correct sample
      solution in order to "simulate" possible student mistakes, and use that to
      "harden" the test suite that an e-learning system uses for judging
      submissions and giving feedback.
