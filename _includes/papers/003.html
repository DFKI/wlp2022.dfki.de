      XML is a well-known and frequently used data format for semi-structured,
      complex and nested data. In this paper, we store tennis data in an XML
      format; a match is structured into sets, games, and points, and for every
      point the location of the tennis field and the trajectory of the ball is
      given in some way. In earlier work we had implemented an analysis of
      tennis data, that were entered by hand, using the declarative logic
      programming toolkit Declare. Recently, we have added an automatic
      recognition of the tennis data from tennis videos using convolutional
      neural networks (CNNs). Unfortunately, the automatically obtained XML
      files from the CNN are unclean and cannot be used for the intended
      analysis. Coordinates are not given in a bird's-eye perspective, but as
      recorded from a camera behind the court. Moreover, the ball trajectories
      have to be reduced to the moments when the ball is hit - instead of one
      position per video frame, i.e. 24 positions per second (the ball is hit
      once about every 1.5 seconds, e.g. a rally with 9 hits can take 13 - 15
      seconds). Also, the CCN frequently fails in recognizing the ball or the
      tennis field. In this paper, we present a process of XML transformation
      based on field notation grammars. We transformed the unclean data obtained
      from the convolutional neural network into structured clean data which can
      then be used for further processing, like data mining. Our transformation
      uses field notation grammars (FNGs) and solves linear equations to project
      x- and y- coordinates into the plane. FNGs have been implemented in
      Declare using Prolog; they extend the common path notation Xpath of XML,
      and they combine XML-processing with Prolog.
