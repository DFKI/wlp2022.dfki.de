      Benefits of literate programming are well-known: by combining source code
      and documentation, concepts can be introduced in a more comprehensible way
      to the reader. Motivated by rendering our Prolog applications and teaching
      examples more readable, we implemented a Jupyter kernel for SICStus
      Prolog. In this paper, we will give a feature overview of this kernel,
      discuss particularities caused by Prolog’s execution mechanism and report
      on our experiences porting the kernel to SWI-Prolog.
