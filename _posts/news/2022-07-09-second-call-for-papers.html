>. As WLP participation no longer requires travel planning and travel expenses,
we announce a second, late submission deadline WLP. In addition to the already
passed standard submission, this allows authors to still contribute on a tighter
schedule of publication. Besides the later notification, contributions of late
submission will receive the same treatment as standard submissions, including
the normal review process. Please distribute this second call for paper further
to potential participants (<a

The Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming brings together researchers interested in logic programming, constraint programming, and related areas like databases, artificial intelligence, and operations research. It serves as the scientific forum of the annual meeting of the Society of Logic Programming (GLP, Gesellschaft fuer Logische Programmierung e.V.).

Contributions are welcome on all theoretical, experimental, and application aspects of logic and constraint logic programming. The topics include, but are not limited to the following areas:
  - Logic and Constraint Logic Programming Languages and Extensions
  - Knowledge Representation and Non-monotonic Reasoning
  - Applications and Application Areas of (C)LP
  - Implementations

In this year, the workshop is organised as part of the 45th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence (KI2022) in Trier. Since KI2022 recently decided to go fully virtual, the WLP announces a second, late submission deadline. In addition to the already passed standard submission, this allows authors to still contribute on a tighter schedule of publication, as WLP participation no longer requires travel planning and travel expenses. Besides the later notification, contributions of late submission will receive the same treatment as standard submissions.
